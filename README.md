# rust-rcon
A Rust RCON client in Java.

## About
Rust pendant to my **[minecraft-rcon](https://github.com/MrGraversen/minecraft-rcon)** library, but mostly non-equivalent because Rust internally has switched to an async websocket network infrastructure - and of course the instruction set differs greatly from that of MineCraft.
